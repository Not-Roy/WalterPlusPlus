Once upon a time,
I was walking through the woods...
and I found a crashed alien spacecraft!
Being the brave little scout that I am,
I investigated further.
The door was letting out an ominous green glow,
and a weird whirrrrr sound.
I opened the door, and looked inside.
I saw a weird cylindrical pod.
So I step inside,
either out of bravery or stupidity.
Or maybe both...
Well, the door closes and starts to copy me!
Clones, Clones, EVERYWHERE.
They're all over the place,
all telling the same Campfire stories,
MY campfire stories!
And I think... I think...
Maybe a handful of them are plotting against me
to use a ray gun,
and eviscerate the REAL me
and take my place.]]
