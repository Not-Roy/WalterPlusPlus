It was a late Autumn night.
I had just finished fishing,
and started walking back to camp.
I heard some dogs barking in the distance,
and I was a little unnerved.
Suddenly I feel a deep chill.
A horrible, unnatural chill.
I kept walking.
Until Woby stopped dead in her tracks.
She was staring at something.
And then I saw it.
A creature in the distance.
This... thing...
It looked like a skeleton wearing a suit of skin.
but it had the horns of a moose.
And its skin looked dead gray.
Apparently I had stared too long,
because it stopped and looked me dead in the eye.
It mumbled something I couldn't understand,
in a deep, demonic voice.
Then it howled and ran out of sight on all fours.]]

When I suddenly felt a deep chill.
A horrible, unnatural chill.
I kept walking.
I just wanted to be back at camp.
When out of nowhere,
Woby stopped dead in her tracks.
She was staring at something.
Then I saw it.
A creature in the distance.
Feasting on something.
This... thing...
It looked like a skeleton wearing a suit of skin,
but it had the horns of a moose.
It's skin looked gray and... dead.
Suddenly it stopped eating.
It turned and looked me in the eye,
and mumbled something I couldn't understand.
Then it howled and stumbled out of sight.]]
