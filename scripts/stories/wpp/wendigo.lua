It was a late Autumn night,
and I was walking back to camp after a fishing trip.
I was a little unnerved,
because I heard some dogs barking in the distance.
When I suddenly felt a deep chill.
A horrible, unnatural chill.
I kept moving on.
I just wanted to be back at camp.
When out of nowhere,
Woby stopped dead in her tracks.
She was staring at something.
She didn't move, didn't make a sound.
Then I saw it.
A creature in the distance.
Feasting on something.
This... thing... looked like it hadn't eaten in years
It's skin looked gray and... dead
Only then did I realize,
That's a Wendigo!]]
